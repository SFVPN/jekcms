Jekyll site to test some workflow options for receiving front-end submissions and how this can integrate into the wider structure of the project.  This uses Staticman to convert form submission into pull requests that can then be accepted and saved content items. It can also be configured to save to a _data file (which may be more suitable for our purposes)
